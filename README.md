# Request Bin

Web Request Bin üóëÔ∏è made with React (w/ Hooks and SSE), Spring WebFlux, Cassandra, and MySQL. Deployment üê≥ using Docker multistage builds in Compose environment. 

In seeking deeper understanding of how one might deliver a "full stack" application with real, portable deployment, this project was born.

I also wanted something that may become useful at times, and something that makes sense to actually deploy. So here we are!

**Avilable at:** https://bin.graversen.io

## Primary Challenges Solved
* Real project using Spring WebFlux, Reactive Repositories, and SSE
* React app, with Hooks, as part of the deliverable
* Continuous delivery pipeline using [Docker Multistage Build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) pattern

## Secondary Challenges Solved
* Make a somewhat mobile-friendly UI
* Use Spring Profile for dev/production
* Establish the whole deployment (Reverse proxy configuration, SSL certificate, DNS, etc.)

## Installation

Since the *Docker Multistage Build* pattern is used, installing from source is as simple as:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-production-build.yml up --build -d
```

## System Overview

The system is composed (hehe!) of a React app served statically through an Nginx, with a Java 11 / Spring Framework 5.1 backend, proxied through the same Nginx.

The Nginx sits on the outer layer of the Docker-Compose UDN (as illustrated below).

I wanted to explore the *Docker Multistage Build* pattern, as a way of containerizing the entire CD lifecycle of an application.  
The *Docker Multistage Build* pattern helps separate the build dependencies from the release dependencies.

**[For the backend](https://github.com/MrGraversen/request-bin/blob/master/server/Docker/Dockerfile)**, this means that you for example don't need the JDK to run the Java app. Only the JRE is necessary. The image comes out at **263 MB**. In a future where weekends are more plentiful, this could be slimmed down even further with the usage of the *Java Module System*.

**[For the frontend](https://github.com/MrGraversen/request-bin/blob/master/client/Docker/Dockerfile)**, it allows you to discard all build artifacts, e.g. `node_modules`, NodeJS itself, and so on. In the end, it is just static HTML, CSS, and JS, served through Nginx. The image comes out at just **22.5 MB**.

## UI

*These are just in case I decide to longer expose the service publicly.*
